# Promises Vs Async Await

What is a promise?

A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created.

The promise object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

A Promise is in one of these states:

- pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.

- fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.

- rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
